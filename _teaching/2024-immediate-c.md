Introduction to Immediate C/C++
=============================

As an experienced tutor, I have had the privilege of guiding students in their journey to master the C/C++ programming languages. My approach to teaching is centered around creating a supportive and engaging learning environment, where students feel encouraged to ask questions and explore their creativity.

Course Overview
-------------

In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of C/C++ programming, including data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming. We will also delve into more advanced topics such as memory management, file input/output, and exception handling.

Teaching Philosophy
-----------------

My teaching philosophy is built around the idea that every student learns differently and at their own pace. I strive to create a personalized learning experience that caters to each student's unique needs and learning style. Through a combination of lectures, discussions, and hands-on exercises, I aim to foster a deep understanding of C/C++ programming concepts and their practical applications.
