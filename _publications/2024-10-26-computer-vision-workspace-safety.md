The growing deployment of computer vision in
industrial processes significantly contributes to strengthening the
manufacturing sector in terms of productivity and safety of the
workers. Manufacturing workers are often working in hazardous
environments handling different dangerous equipment putting
their life on the line every day. Work accidents are reminders
for which companies must make efforts to reduce its occurrence
and their adverse impact on the lives of workers. The growing
deployment of computer vision in industrial processes signifi-
cantly contributes to strengthening the manufacturing sector in
terms of productivity and safety of the workers. Manufacturing
workers are often working in hazardous environments handling
different dangerous equipment putting their life on the line
every day. Work accidents are reminders for which companies
must make efforts to reduce its occurrence and their adverse
impact on the lives of workers. Due to the inherent complexities
of construction sites, safety management remains a persistent
challenge and a critical responsibility. The primary objective of
construction safety management is to guarantee the project’s
successful and secure completion, prioritize the well-being of
workers, and mitigate construction-related accidents and their
associated costs. The advent of computer vision (CV) technology
has revolutionized traditional approaches to construction safety
management. This paper examines the transformative impact
of CV technology on construction site safety and management
efficiency from an application-oriented perspective. Initially, the
paper provides an overview of the fundamental principles and
methodologies underpinning CV technology, accompanied by
a detailed description of the literature analysis methodology
employed. Subsequently, the paper delves into the diverse appli-
cations of CV technology, encompassing real-time construction
site monitoring, worker safety management, equipment behavior
tracking, and material quality control. Furthermore, the paper
highlights the substantial potential of CV technology in mitigating
accidents, enhancing safety performance, and offers valuable
insights into future research directions. In conclusion, this paper
presents a comprehensive overview of the construction industry’s
pursuit of leveraging CV technology to elevate safety management
practices, serving as both an informative and instructive resource.
