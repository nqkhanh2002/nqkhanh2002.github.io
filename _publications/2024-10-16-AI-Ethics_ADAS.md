The deployment of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) powered by computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) raises critical ethical questions, particularly regarding the balance between safety, privacy, and fairness. While AI-driven ADAS technology promises to enhance transportation safety and efficiency by supporting drivers and reducing accidents, it also presents unique ethical challenges. This paper investigates the ethical risks associated with AI in ADAS, including concerns related to data privacy, liability, and algo-rithmic fairness. By analyzing existing literature and relevant case studies, this study outlines key ethical dilemmas-such as consent, data handling, and algorithmic transparency-that arise when ADAS is put into practice. The paper further examines methodologies and techniques to mitigate these ethical risks, focusing on industry best practices and regulatory frameworks. Finally, it provides recommendations for researchers, developers, policymakers, and public stakeholders to guide the responsible development and deployment of ADAS technology. Through this analysis, the research contributes to a nuanced understanding of the ethical considerations in ADAS and offers strategies to responsibly advance AI applications in vehicle safety. Our analysis suggests that Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are likely to have a profound impact on both individual drivers and society at large. To be beneficial and aligned with societal values, we argue that ADAS technologies must be appropriately responsive to the needs of users, developers, and the broader community. Key features such as increased driver support, enhanced situational awareness, and personalized assistance could make ADAS especially valuable in promoting road safety and improving driving experiences. However, these same features can also make drivers vulnerable to overreliance on or inappropriate influence by the technology, underscoring the need for robust safeguards. Moreover, as ADAS becomes widely deployed, it introduces broader effects on traffic dynamics, road safety standards, and societal expectations surrounding driving. These knock-on effects may require technical adjustments and policy interventions to ensure that ADAS fosters safe and beneficial cooperation on the road and achieves broadly equitable outcomes. Finally, given that the current landscape of ADAS evaluation largely emphasizes technical performance, it is crucial to invest in holistic evaluations that include human-ADAS interaction, system reliability, and impacts at the societal level. Such comprehensive assessments are essential to support responsible development and deployment in this domain.
