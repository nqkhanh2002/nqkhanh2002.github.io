Horse racing’s burgeoning popularity has spurred extensive research into pre-
dictive analysis and strategic decision-making within the sport. The digital age
has ushered in an era of unprecedented data complexity and volume related
to horse racing, demanding sophisticated analytical approaches. Machine
learning, with its broad reach across various sectors, is making significant
inroads into the sports betting industry, particularly in horse racing, a domain
characterized by substantial financial stakes and widespread interest. Pre-
dicting horse racing outcomes is inherently challenging due to the multitude
of factors at play. This study endeavors to advance the field by leveraging
machine learning algorithms to forecast horse racing results using a compre-
hensive dataset encompassing race data from Australia (2015-2024) sourced
from Punters.com.au, Australia’s premier horse racing platform, and data
from the United Kingdom (including Great Britain and Ireland) spanning 2021
to 2023. A stacked ensemble model incorporating six algorithms – LightGBM,
XGBoost, CatBoostRegressor, HistGradientBoostingRegressor, AdaBoostRe-
gressor, and TabNetRegressor – was employed to predict the victor of each
race. This research can be valuable to stakeholders and researchers alike,
offering insights for further analysis and experimentation in this field.
