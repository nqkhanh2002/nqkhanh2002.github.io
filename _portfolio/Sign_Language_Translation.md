## Achievements
- Built a real-time sign language translation system supporting multiple languages, providing an inclusive communication tool through cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
- Enhanced accessibility with text normalization, speech-to-text features, and support for internationalization in over 107 languages, making the platform globally adaptable.

## Productization
- **Multi-Modal Translation**: Developed sign-to-text and text-to-sign translation capabilities using TypeScript, integrating machine learning models with a focus on accuracy and latency reduction.
- **Interactive 3D Avatar Visualization**: Leveraged HumanGAN technology and 3D avatar animations for realistic and engaging sign language representations, enhancing accessibility for users with hearing impairments.
- **Cross-Platform Usability**: Designed a seamless user experience across both desktop and mobile platforms, with a responsive interface that supports speech-to-text, video output sharing, and real-time translation updates.
- **Global Language Support**: Implemented a robust internationalization layer with support for 107 languages, ensuring the platform's versatility and effectiveness for users worldwide.
- **Skeleton Viewer for Motion Analysis**: Incorporated a Skeleton Viewer for precise analysis and visualization of hand and body movements, improving translation accuracy and user feedback mechanisms.
