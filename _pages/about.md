Work and Research
-----------
His current work at Silver Tiger focuses on designing and implementing multi-agent orchestration logic for GenAI use cases including chatbots, AI assistants, and Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) systems. He also develops deep learning models for phishing webpage detection, leveraging technologies like LangChain, LangGraph, and AWS.

Previously at VinBigData, he contributed to the SpeechWorld Data Framework, developing data crawling, labeling, and Transcript Forced Alignment (TFA) workflows. He enhanced Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) models and improved the SpeechBase system with model tuning, backend improvements, and online/active learning capabilities.

At ThinkPrompt, he worked with a team of 3+ AI Engineers, designing and deploying 20+ predictive ML models that achieved 20% WIN rate and 50% PLACE rate, resulting in 150% net ROI. He implemented comprehensive MLOps workflows and architected end-to-end ML infrastructure using AWS EC2, Docker, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.

His earlier experience includes developing recommendation systems at MAICO Group and designing algorithmic problems for the Vietnam Olympiad in Informatics (VNOI). Through his work with tools like TensorFlow, LangChain, AWS, and FastAPI, he strives to deliver AI-driven solutions that make a tangible impact.
